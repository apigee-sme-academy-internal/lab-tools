# Lab Tools

This repo holds common tools that are used by lab creators while developing
the lab content itself.

## How to use the tools


Clone the repo

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:apigee-sme-academy-internal/lab-tools.git
```

Add the bin directory into your path

```shell script
export PATH=`$(pwd)/lab-tools/bin:$PATH`
```

## gdoc-2-markdown.sh

This script takes an existing Google Doc and converts it to the markdown
format used by Qwiklabs. The script itself uses the claat tool to do the
conversion. You do not need to have claat installed in your system. The claat 
binary (for Darwin) is already available in the lab-tools bin directory.

Example usage:

```shell script
gdoc-2-markdown.sh 1pMq49viVv0IF81GRIEoGnjeigfwUAmAZvaKbmNH_Syk enbl008-apigee-appmod-lab-2-implement-oauth-2-password-grant
```

The script does a few things:

1. Uses the claat tool to download the gdoc and convert it to markdown
2. Replaces the existing `instructions/en.md` from your lab with the `index.md` generated by claat
3. Replaces the contents of the `instructions/img` directory with the ones from claat.
4. Applies post-processing logic on the new `.md` file


### gdoc-2-markdown.sh - MD syntax highlighting

One of the post processing activities done by this tool is to enable syntax highlight in code blocks

To get syntax highlighting use the `!lang format` tag at the beginning of your code blocks within the Google Doc.

Here are some examples:

```shell script
!lang xml
<Sample>
  <Foo></Foo>
</Sample>
```

```shell script
!lang shel script
echo "hello world"
```

```shell script
!lang json
{
  "foo": "bar"  
}
```

You can use any language tag that understood by Qwiklabs.
